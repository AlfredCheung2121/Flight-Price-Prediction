Non-stop flights are the cheapest on average, with a mean price of $5,025, while flights with 3 stops are the most expensive, averaging $13,112. The correlation coefficient of 0.621 indicates a moderately strong positive relationship between the number of stops and ticket price. This suggests that more stops generally lead to higher fares."

Each line represents a specific airline, showing how price varies across the observed range of values. Airlines such as Jet Airways, Air India, and Multiple Carriers display wider price ranges and more variability, while budget airlines like GoAir and SpiceJet show tighter, more consistent pricing patterns. The dense overlap of lines in the lower price range (below 20,000) suggests that many airlines operate within similar pricing bands, though premium carriers and classes (e.g., Vistara Premium Economy) occupy higher price segments. This model-based visualization helps identify airline-specific pricing trends and supports comparison across carrier types."
